COSC 1320: Group Assignment 2

I. Implement a method that generates an array with random numbers (either integers or real
numbers). 

II. Provide three member functions, each function will sort this array using the bubble sort in a
different way:
1. For 1st function, use the methods provided in the ArrayList to implement the bubble sort (You
have to initiate the ArrayList with numbers in your random numbers array).
2. For 2nd function, use the compareTo method to aid the bubble sort.
3. For 3rd function, use the precedes and/or follows methods to achieve the bubble sort.

III. Design a GUI program with a menu and buttons to let the user choose either one of the three
methods to sort the array. Display the sorted array in a text field. Your menu should also have
a button that allows the user to select the generation of an array of random numbers.
